# Material-Button
A recreation of the Material Design Button ripple effect.  

This repository is based on the article ["How to Recreate the Ripple Effect of Material Design Buttons"](https://css-tricks.com/how-to-recreate-the-ripple-effect-of-material-design-buttons/) from Bret Cameron.  

## Demo
Live-demo of the latest state: [git.tim-greller.de/btn](https://tim-greller.de/git/btn/).
  
## Usage
1. Include the files in your projects:
   ```html
   <script src="https://tim-greller.de/git/btn/button.js"></script>
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://tim-greller.de/git/btn/button.css">
   ```  
2. Then you can create button elements with the class "ripple-button" and you can add individual styles like colouring and positioning.
   ```html
   <button class="ripple-button">Press me!</button>
   ```
